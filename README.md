In order to drive alignment in the organization, it is important that the CEO establishes and communicates the company vision and the strategy to achieve that vision.

Employees are more engaged when they understand how they contribute to achieving the company’s overall vision.
To ensure that every employee is aligned you need an approach that:
- Keeps everyone working towards the vision
- Establishes priorities and what’s most important
- Allows managers to track and measure their team’s progress against their goals

But how do you work towards alignment in a way that’s simple to follow and gets everyone aligned?
Introducing myV2MOM.
myV2MOM is an alignment framework which is at the forefront of how Salesforce runs its business.
A corporate V2MOM is created at the start of a year by the CEO which gets cascaded down to individuals so everyone can create their own V2MOM. This ensures that every employee has a clear understanding of the organization's priorities every year, and how their role contributes to the company's overall success.

Use the myV2MOM app to engage your employees in conversations about their and the company's priorities on an ongoing basis.
